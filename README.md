# Brightspace Quiz Review

Brightspace Quiz Review is a Firefox extension that allows users to hide answers on already completed quizzes. As of the time of writing, Brightspace does not allow users to hide the answers in completed quizzes which makes it harder to study. This extension provides a solution to that.
## Installation

Brightspace Quiz Review can be installed through [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/brightspace-quiz-review/). It can also be installed locally by downloading the zip and following the [instructions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension) under Installing.
    
## Usage
**NOTE:** Do not use Brightspace Quiz Review on a quiz that you're currently completing. The developers will not be responsible for anything that happens if you use the extension on a live quiz.

To use Brightspace Quiz Review, open a past completed quiz and then open the extension. There will be two buttons: "Hide answers" and "Show answers". Use the respective buttons to change the visibility of the answers. Note that clicking the "Show answers" button will reload the page.
